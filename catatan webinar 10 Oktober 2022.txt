---- Q & A Session

Q: Is what is being shared now for the expert track?

A: No - this is for both tracks. We are sharing what the data sources look like and how you can start exploring them - we have three speakers for 3 of the main data sources


Q: Can we get the data sources for the youth track again? I missed it. Would we get access to the slides?

A:Yes we will share the slides via e-mail

Q: Does curated datasets mean we can only use these data selected datasets during the hackathon?

A: No! You can definitely include other public data sets too (again, public not private). We just want to share a set of datasets to make it easier on you


Information: The theme for the Hackathon will be revealed on the 31st of October.
